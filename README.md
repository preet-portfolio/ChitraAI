# ChitraAI

Welcome to ChitraAI, a project that is a clone of the popular DALL-E AI using the Vite framework, React JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.

As a student studying Interactive Design, I have always been fascinated by the potential of AI and its ability to create unique and interesting visuals. That's why I was particularly drawn to the DALL-E AI, and I wanted to create my own version of it that I could use for my own projects and experiments.

Using the Vite framework, I was able to quickly set up a development environment and start building the project. The use of React JavaScript allowed me to create a responsive and dynamic user interface, while Tailwind CSS provided a clean and consistent design.

One of the things I loved most about this project was the ability to create unique and interesting visuals with the help of AI. It was also a great opportunity to learn and work with new technologies such as Vite, React and Tailwind CSS.

If you're interested in AI and its potential for creating unique and interesting visuals, I encourage you to check out ChitraAI and see what it can do. And if you're a student like me, who is studying Interactive Design, this project will be a great opportunity for you to learn and experiment with new technologies.

Please feel free to use this project for your own experiments, and if you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
